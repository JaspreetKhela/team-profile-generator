**Description**: This is a team profile generator that runs as a Node.js application using the Command Line Interface. This generator prompts a manager for information about himself/herself and his/her team before it generates a HTML document displaying information about the team. This generator steamlines the team profile-creation process by allowing the manager to focus on the content of the HTML document while it automates the data structuring and styling processes.
